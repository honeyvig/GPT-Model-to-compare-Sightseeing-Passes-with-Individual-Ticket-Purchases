create a custom GPT model for use on a Wordpress website that effectively compares two sightseeing passes against the option of purchasing tickets individually. The ideal candidate should have experience in natural language processing and be adept at building AI models tailored for specific use cases.

The basics for how this should be done we have mostly already outlined through ChatGPT and are in the process of building spreadsheets to supply the data.

What we would like help with is implementation and testing as well as assistance with generating the best outputs. We would also like to find ways to automate the data inputs as we do not have access to APIs that would normally supply the data. Much of it is manual.

==================
To create a custom GPT model for comparing sightseeing passes with individual ticket purchases on a WordPress website, you would need to break down the process into several stages. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to approach it:
1. Understanding the Task

You are aiming to build a comparison tool that uses GPT models to compare the benefits of purchasing sightseeing passes versus individual tickets. This involves providing detailed outputs based on the data you manually input, including ticket prices, locations, and the benefits of the passes. The GPT model will need to analyze this data and generate insightful and relevant comparisons.
2. Data Collection and Structuring

Since you do not have access to APIs, you’ll need to manually collect the data on sightseeing passes and individual tickets. This might include:

    Prices of individual tickets vs. passes.
    Details of what’s included in each pass (e.g., attractions, skip-the-line features).
    User Reviews (optional, but useful for qualitative data).
    Geographical Scope (which locations the tickets or passes cover).

Spreadsheet Format Example:

You can organize the data in a CSV or Excel sheet for easy processing. For example:
Pass Name	Price	Attractions Covered	Additional Features	Ticket Price	Ticket Locations	Comments
City Pass	$100	20+ attractions	Skip lines at 10	$15 each	Multiple	Great value
Museum Pass	$75	5 museums	Free audio guide	$20 each	Museum only	Good for museums
3. Custom GPT Model Development

To create a model that compares the data, you'll need a Python environment (or other AI frameworks) to build and train the GPT model.
Step 1: Install OpenAI API

Ensure you have access to OpenAI’s API (GPT-3 or GPT-4) and install the necessary Python libraries:

pip install openai

Step 2: Preprocessing the Data

Before feeding it into GPT, you need to format your data correctly. Since your dataset is manual, you will likely need to use text input like this:

import openai
import pandas as pd

# API Key for OpenAI
openai.api_key = "your-openai-api-key"

# Sample Data Input from your CSV
data = {
    "Pass Name": ["City Pass", "Museum Pass"],
    "Price": [100, 75],
    "Attractions Covered": ["20+ attractions", "5 museums"],
    "Additional Features": ["Skip lines at 10", "Free audio guide"],
    "Ticket Price": [15, 20],
    "Ticket Locations": ["Multiple", "Museum only"],
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Convert data to a string format for GPT input
input_text = f"Compare the following sightseeing passes:\n"
for idx, row in df.iterrows():
    input_text += f"Pass: {row['Pass Name']}\nPrice: {row['Price']} USD\nAttractions: {row['Attractions Covered']}\nFeatures: {row['Additional Features']}\nTicket Price: {row['Ticket Price']} USD\nLocations: {row['Ticket Locations']}\n\n"

# Create the prompt for GPT to analyze
prompt = input_text + "Please compare the benefits and drawbacks of purchasing a sightseeing pass vs individual tickets."

Step 3: Query OpenAI GPT

You can now use the openai.Completion.create() function to get GPT to process your input:

response = openai.Completion.create(
  engine="text-davinci-003",
  prompt=prompt,
  temperature=0.7,
  max_tokens=300
)

# Get the response from GPT
comparison_output = response.choices[0].text.strip()
print(comparison_output)

4. Integrating with WordPress

After developing the model, you can integrate it into your WordPress website to allow users to interact with the chatbot and compare sightseeing passes:

    Set up a WordPress plugin: You’ll need to create a custom plugin or use an existing one to embed Python scripts or call your backend model via an API. You can use the WP REST API to handle requests from the frontend to your Python backend.

    Backend Communication: Develop a REST API in Python (Flask or Django) that your WordPress site can call to send user inputs (queries) to the GPT model, process the data, and return the results.

Here’s a simple Flask example for setting up the API:

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import openai

app = Flask(__name__)

openai.api_key = "your-openai-api-key"

@app.route('/compare', methods=['POST'])
def compare_passes():
    data = request.json
    pass_1 = data['pass_1']
    pass_2 = data['pass_2']
    
    prompt = f"Compare these two sightseeing passes:\nPass 1: {pass_1}\nPass 2: {pass_2}"
    
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=prompt,
        temperature=0.7,
        max_tokens=300
    )

    return jsonify({'comparison': response.choices[0].text.strip()})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

    Frontend: On the WordPress side, you will send a POST request to the /compare endpoint to send user inputs and retrieve the AI-generated comparison.

function getComparison() {
    const pass_1 = "City Pass: $100, covers 20+ attractions";
    const pass_2 = "Museum Pass: $75, covers 5 museums";

    fetch('http://your-flask-api-url/compare', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({ pass_1, pass_2 })
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        document.getElementById("comparison-result").innerHTML = data.comparison;
    })
    .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
}

5. Automating Data Inputs

You can use web scraping or data import tools to automatically update your CSVs with the latest data, minimizing manual work. Libraries like BeautifulSoup (for scraping) or pandas (for importing and managing CSV data) can automate this process.

import pandas as pd
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Example: Scrape sightseeing passes data
url = "https://example.com/sightseeing-passes"
response = requests.get(url)

soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
data = []

# Extract relevant data from the webpage
for pass_element in soup.find_all('div', class_='pass'):
    name = pass_element.find('h3').text
    price = pass_element.find('span', class_='price').text
    attractions = pass_element.find('p', class_='attractions').text
    data.append([name, price, attractions])

# Save data to CSV
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=["Pass Name", "Price", "Attractions"])
df.to_csv('sightseeing_passes.csv', index=False)

6. Testing and Optimization

Test the integration thoroughly by simulating real-world usage scenarios. Adjust the model’s response quality, handle edge cases, and optimize for speed.
7. Deployment

Host the Python API on a cloud service like AWS or Heroku, and integrate it with your WordPress site through RESTful API calls.
Conclusion:

This solution involves integrating GPT models to compare sightseeing passes, setting up an AI-driven backend with Python (Flask/Django), and connecting it to your WordPress website. This ensures that users get automated, real-time comparisons, providing them with valuable insights when choosing between different passes.
